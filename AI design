# System Design

## Overview
The Responsible India Platform is a centralized website that allows citizens to report public safety and civic responsibility issues in a simple and transparent way. The platform supports reporting from both CCTV-covered areas and non-CCTV areas and is designed to expand gradually by adding new problem categories one by one.

## User Roles
- **Citizen/User**: Reports issues and follows public safety initiatives
- **Admin/Authority**: Reviews submissions and takes action
- **System (AI – Future Scope)**: Validates and prioritizes reports

## System Flow
1. User visits the website
2. User views active initiatives (starting with helmet safety)
3. User submits a report by uploading:
   - Photo (optional but recommended)
   - Location
   - Basic description
4. User submits the report for review
5. System stores the submission
6. Admin reviews the report and takes necessary action
7. Status updates are recorded for transparency
