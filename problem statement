# Problem Statement

In India, many public safety and civic responsibility issues such as **helmet rule violations, unsafe traffic behavior, and unclean public areas** continue to exist even though **CCTV cameras and basic public infrastructure are available in some places**. However, many areas still do not have CCTV coverage, and problems in those locations often go unnoticed.

Citizens who want to act responsibly often do not know **where to inform**, **how to inform**, or **what happens after they inform**. Because there is no single, trusted platform for reporting and tracking these issues, many genuine problems remain unsolved and people slowly lose interest in participating.

Currently, public safety initiatives and government schemes are introduced separately, making it difficult for citizens to understand them clearly or take part in a meaningful way. This lack of connection between citizens and action reduces the effectiveness of existing systems.

There is a need for a **centralized, easy-to-use website platform** whose main intention is to **connect citizens with real-world problems**. Through this website, people can:
- Learn about ongoing public safety initiatives
- Upload photos, location, and basic details
- Inform about issues **in areas where CCTV cameras are available**
- Inform about issues **even when CCTV cameras are not available**

The platform will start with **helmet safety** as a small but high-impact problem and will **expand step by step** to include other issues such as cleanliness and civic responsibility. By adding problems **one by one**, the system ensures focus, accountability, and encourages responsible citizen participation to help improve India gradually and sustainably.
